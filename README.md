This is an experiment with brush drawing in WebGL, code written in typescript.

The original code was written in 2018 in React. To apply to the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), you need code written without a framework, so I converted this to plain typescript.

How to run locally:

```sh
$ tsc -w
$ now dev # or your favorite static site server
```

How to deploy:

```sh
$ now
```
